== Overview ==
ActivePHP (otherwise known as ActiveTable) is a very simple implementation of the Active Record pattern in PHP5.
Using ActiveTable, you can define a class that will automatically define setters/getters for columns and 
provide you with the basic CRUD methods needed in any application.

ActivePHP supports MySQL and Oracle (8i and 9i have been tested). It uses the PEAR::DB abstraction layer for doing most of its work, so any limitations on what 
database this library can interact with can be resolved easily; another SQL generation driver for your RDBMS of choice is all that is needed.

== Requirements ==
ActiveTable requires the following:

* PHP 5 (5.1 preferred)
    * PEAR and the PEAR::DB and PEAR::Log packages.
* MySQL (4 or 5), Oracle (8i, 9i, or 10g)
    * MySQL: Table(s) with an auto-incrememting primary key.
    * Oracle uses the 'rowid' present in every table.

== Use ==
Please see the example file in docs/ for example uses.

== Notes on Oracle ==
ActiveTable uses the Oracle rowid internally. Unless you have an auto-
incrementing integer in your Oracle table, it is strongly advised that you 
set the $primary_key to 'rowid' for any Oracle tables.

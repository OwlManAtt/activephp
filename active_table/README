== Overview ==
ActivePHP (otherwise known as ActiveTable) is a very simple implementation of the Active Record pattern in PHP5.
Using ActiveTable, you can define a class that will automatically define setters/getters for columns and 
provide you with the basic CRUD methods needed in any application.

ActivePHP is written for MySQL, although it may work (to a limited extent) with other database for read-only
operations. It uses the PEAR::DB abstraction layer for doing most of its work, so any limitations on what 
database this library can interact with can be resolved easily.

== Requirements ==
ActiveTable requires the following:

* PHP 5 (5.1 preferred)
    * PEAR and the PEAR::DB and PEAR::Log packages.
* MySQL, Oracle (see note below regarding Oracle)
* Table(s) with an auto-incrememting primary key.

== Use ==
Please see the example file in docs/ for example uses.

== Notes on Oracle ==
ActiveTable uses the Oracle rowid internally. Unless you have an auto-incrementing integer
in your Oracle table, it is strongly advised that you set the primary_key to rowid for any Oracle
tables.

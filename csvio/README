== Overview ==
CSVI/O is a class that allows one to move data between databases, spreadsheets, and other applications that understand the CSV format.

Comma-seperated value files are becoming increasingly popular for simple tasks. XML is nice, but it is too large a hammer for certain nails.

CSVI/O utilizes the power of ActiveTable, another component in the ActivePHP Suite, to do it's database read/write operations. Any database engine that ActiveTable supports can be used as a storage engine or datasource for CSVIO.

== Requirements ==
CSVIO requires the following:

* PHP 5 (5.1 preferred)
    * PEAR and the PEAR::DB package.
* APHP's ActiveTable.
* A RDBMS supported by ActiveTable.
* A database table to store your CSV's data in.

== Use ==
Please see the docs/ folder for examples.
